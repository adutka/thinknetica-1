После жарких дебатов, было принято решение, что необходимо внести изменения в архитектуру нашей библиотеки.

Класс LibraryManager теперь должен обслуживать много книг и читателей. Также в него включена новая функциональность - компоновка полезных сообщений.

Для читателя:

Dear Ivan Testenko!

You should return a book "War and Peace" authored by Leo Tolstoy in 36 hours.

Otherwise you will be charged $12.30 per hour.

By the way, you are on 333 page now and you need 5.40 hours to finish reading "War and Peace"
